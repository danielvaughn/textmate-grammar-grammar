# Textmate Grammar Grammar

Yo dawg I heard you like Textmate grammars, so I made you a textmate grammar for your textmate grammar.

Building a syntax highlighter for VSCode can be kind of annoying.
To make it easier to understand the root groups and the scopes they create, I've created a grammar that lists out each scope as a language literal.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:danielvaughn/textmate-grammar-grammar.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd textmate-grammar-grammar`
3. Press `f5` to launch debug mode
4. Open the `test.tgg` file in your debugging session
